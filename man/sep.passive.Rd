\title{Passive surveillance sensitivity}
\usage{
sep.passive(step.p, p.inf.u, se, N, n, pstar.c)
}
\arguments{
\item{step.p}{vector or matrix of detection probabilities for each step in the detection process.
If a vector each value represents a step probability for a single calculation. If a matrix, columns
are step probabilities and rows are simulation iterations.}

\item{p.inf.u}{the probability of infection in units sampled, 
equivalent to the positive predictive value of clinical signs of disease 
(for a given prior probability of infection). Either a scalar or vector with length equal 
to number of rows in step.p.}

\item{se}{unit sensitivity of test (proportion). Either a scalar or vector with length equal 
to number of rows in step.p.}

\item{N}{population size. Either a scalar or vector with length equal 
to number of rows in step.p}

\item{n}{number of units tested per cluster reporting suspected disease. Either a scalar or vector with length equal 
to number of rows in step.p}

\item{pstar.c}{cluster-level design prevalence (proportion). Either a scalar or vector with length equal 
to number of rows in step.p}
}
\value{
a list of 2 elements, the estimated cluster-level and population-level sensitivities.
If step.p is a vector, values are scalars, if step.p is a matrix, values are vectors with 
length equal to the number of rows in step.p
}
\description{
Estimates the population sensitivity of a passive surveillance system. 
Assumes comprehensive population coverage and samling of representative affected units 
from infected clusters
