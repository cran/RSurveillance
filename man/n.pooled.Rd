\title{Sample size for pooled testing for freedom}
\usage{
n.pooled(sep, k, pstar, pse, psp = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sep}{desired population sensitivity (scalar or vector)}

\item{k}{pool size (constant across pools) (scalar or vector of same length as sep)}

\item{pstar}{design prevalence (scalar or vector of same length as sep)}

\item{pse}{pool-level sensitivity (scalar or vector of same length as sep)}

\item{psp}{pool-level specificity (scalar or vector of same length as sep)}
}
\value{
vector of sample sizes
}
\description{
Calculates sample size to achieve desired
  population-level sensitivity, assuming pooled sampling
  and allowing for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the pooled test
