\title{Hypergeometric population specificity calculation}
\usage{
sph.hp(N, n, c = 1, sp)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{population size (scalar or vector of same length as n)}

\item{n}{sample size (scalar or vector)}

\item{c}{The cut-point number of positives to classify a cluster
as positive, default=1, if positives < c result is negative,
>= c is positive (scalar or vector of same length as n)}

\item{sp}{test unit specificity (scalar or vector of same length as n)}
}
\value{
a vector of population-level specificities
}
\description{
Calculates population specificity for a finite population
and imperfect test, using Hypergeometric distribution
