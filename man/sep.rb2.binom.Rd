\title{Binomial risk-based population sensitivity for 2 risk factors}
\usage{
sep.rb2.binom(pstar, rr1, ppr1, rr2, ppr2, n, se)
}
\arguments{
\item{pstar}{design prevalence (scalar)}

\item{rr1}{relative risks for first level risk factor (vector of values corresponding
to the number of risk strata)}

\item{ppr1}{population proportions for first level risk factor (vector of
same length as rr1)}

\item{rr2}{relative risks for second level risk factor,
matrix, rows = levels of rr1, cols = levels of rr2}

\item{ppr2}{population proportions for second level
risk factor, matrix, rows = levels of rr1, cols = levels of rr2}

\item{n}{matrix of number tested for each risk group
(rows = levels of rr1, cols = levels of rr2)}

\item{se}{test unit sensitivity (scalar)}
}
\value{
list of 4 elements, a scalar of population-level sensitivity
  a matrix of EPI values, a vector of corresponding Adjusted risks for
  the first risk factor and a matrix of adjusted risks for the second
  risk factor
}
\description{
Calculates risk-based population sensitivity for
  two risk factors, using binomial method (assumes a large population)
