\title{Sample size to achieve desired (posterior) probability of freedom}
\usage{
n.pfree(pfree, prior, p.intro, pstar, se, N = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{pfree}{desired probability of freedom (scalar or vector)}

\item{prior}{prior probability of freedom before surveillance (scalar
or vector of same length as pfree)}

\item{p.intro}{probability of introduction for time period (scalar
or vector of same length as pfree)}

\item{pstar}{design prevalence (scalar
or vector of same length as pfree)}

\item{se}{unit sensitivity (scalar
or vector of same length as pfree)}

\item{N}{population size (scalar
or vector of same length as pfree)}
}
\value{
a list of 3 elements, the first a vector of sample sizes
and the second a corresponding vector of population sensitivity values
and the third a vector of adjusted priors
}
\description{
Calculates the sample size required to achieve a
  given value for probability of disease freedom
